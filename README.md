# TWITTER-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-USING-STREAMING-API

### ABSTRACT
Opinion mining is the computational study of people’s opinions, sentiment, attitudes, and emotions expressed in written language. Sentiment analysis plays an important role in analyzing opinion mining and sentiment in texts. With rapid growth of social media, millions of users are sharing opinions on different aspects of life every day. To extract sentiment on particular topic or person from large data efficient techniques are required to collect data and extract meaningful information from them.

This project aims to provide an interactive automatic system which predicts the sentiment of real time tweets in twitter with particular hash tags using classification techniques in python. A precise method is used for predicting weighted sentiment polarity, which helps to improve marketing strategies.

### INTRODUCTION
With the increase in the popularity of social networking, micro-blogging and blogging websites, a huge quantity of data is generated. We know that the internet is the collection of networks. The age of the internet has changed the way people express their thoughts and feelings. The people are connecting with each other with the help of the internet through the blog post, online conversation forums, and many more. The people check the reviews or ratings of the movies before watching that movie in theaters. The quantity of information is unreasonable for a normal person to analyze with the help of naive technique. Sentiment analysis is mainly concerned with the identification and classification of opinions or emotions of each tweet. Sentiment analysis is broadly classified in the two types first one is a feature or aspect based sentiment analysis and the other is objectivity based sentiment analysis.The tweets related to movie reviews come under the category of the feature based sentiment analysis. Objectivity based sentiment analysis does the exploration of the tweets which are related to the emotions like hate, miss, love etc.

### SENTIMENT ANALYSIS 
Sentiment analysis, also referred to as opinion mining, is an approach to natural language processing (NLP) that identifies the emotional tone behind a body of text. It involves the use of data mining, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to mine text for sentiment and subjective information. This is a popular way for organization's to determine and categorize opinions about a product, service or idea.

### TWITTER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
Sentiment Analysis is a technique used in text mining. Twitter Sentiment Analysis may, therefore, be described as a text mining technique for analyzing the underlying sentiment of a text message, i.e., a tweet. Twitter sentiment or opinion expressed through it may be positive, negative or neutral. However, no algorithm can give you 100% accuracy or prediction on sentiment analysis.

### TWITTER STREAMING API
An API , is the instruction set created for developers to interact with some type of technology. Twitter has an open API that allows external developers to develop technology which rely on Twitter’s data. To get real-time tweets, Twitter provides the Twitter Streaming API. The Twitter streaming API is used to download twitter messages in real time. It is useful for obtaining a high volume of tweets, or for creating a live feed using a site stream or user stream. Twitter’s Streaming API pushes data as tweets happen in near real-time.

### WHY NAIVE BAYE'S CLASSIFIER
Naive Bayes model is easy to build and particularly useful for very large data sets. Along with simplicity, Naive Bayes is known to outperform even highly sophisticated classification methods.The main advantage of Naive Bayes classifier is that it analyses each feature independently. So it makes the use of all the features in feature vector.Another reason of using Naïve Bayesian classifier is that it is simple to use and can be scalable. This classifier as compared to all other classifiers:

1. Has high precision
2. Need less training data
3. Highly scalable.
4. It scales linearly with the number of predictors and data points.
5. Can be used for both binary and multi-class classification problems.
6. Handles continuous and discrete data.
7. Return’s not only the prediction but also the degree of certainty, which can be
very useful.
8. Easily updatable if new training data is received
